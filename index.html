                    <p>I've joined a group called Z.E.R.T which relolves around real world training. I've been a member since Janurary 2014 and have participated in a handfull of actual classes hosted by their extremly experienced instructors. I've had the pleasure of meeting a lot of local member to bring new and better ideas to the table for future classes. Z.E.R.T. is an organization that uses “Zombie” as a metaphor for any natural or man-made disasters that will occur in our lives; Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, criminal attacks or any type of situation where being prepared, trained and most importantly, armed with the proper mindset is required to see you and your family through to safety. Z.E.R.T. was officially launched in Las Vegas, November 2011 and now has 23,000+ members in 41 different countries! Over 600 of these members are located in Las Vegas Nevada USA. Members are divided into Squadrons. A Squadron is an area/country represented by a letter/s, for example, the X Squadron represents the West Coast of America. Each member of Z.E.R.T. is assigned a Call Sign and a Squadron designation.<a href="http://zertnation.com/product/1st-year-membership-package/?v=7516fd43adaa" target="_blank" title="1stYearMembership" class="zert">Join Today!</a></p>

                    <p>I've always liked to cook as a young child and have wanted to go to  a culernary school whenever i have time. I've refuse to eat sauces from a jar and push to make recipes better than they were. Even during my time in college I would cook my own awesome meals from scratch. I think i've always loved cooking becuase I don't want to have to ever depend on someone else to make my food!</p>

                    <p>I've been playing video games since i was about 6 years old when my parents gave me a super nintendo for Christmas. My real gaming life didn't happen until Socom 1 came out on the playstation 2. When this game hit the market and online play was very new and still ran off dial-up, i spent hundreds of hours online with random people. My mother always thought I was just talking to myself or the game instead of other live people on the other end. I switched over to the Xbox when all my close friends went to the xbox exclusivly over the playstation. This was a hard choice and took time to get used to what I thought was a horrible life decision on my own end. Around the XboxOne i was hooked and stuck within the game system without remorse of returing to PlayStation. I currenly play OverWatch but am extremly excited for the release of Battlefield1!!</p>

                        <p>I've worked for McDonalds Corp. for over 8 years and have been a manager for just over 6 years. I was recently promoted to the General Manager of the Chowchilla location. I also work at a firearms manufacture in fresno, Kaufmann Tactical Firearms. This of course is the fun job and never feels like a day of work. I left California State University of Fresno because i didn't feel i was actually getting anything for myself out of the school. I decided coding and software enginerring was the way i wanted to go. Working for a firearms manufacture i do get to do a great deal of shooting and joined a group called ZERT to get extended training as a civilian. Even with work and school i still find to get on my XboxOne and game until the sun comes up. My current game of choise ofcourse, is OverWatch, but soon to be a no life zombie once Battlefield 1 is released.  </p>
